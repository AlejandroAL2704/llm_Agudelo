These elements are primarily made up of atoms such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, which absorbed light during the day, resulting in blue-green coloration. These substances also absorb heat from sunlight during the day, causing the air to become less dense, leading to the formation of higher clouds with more blue hues. Additionally, various other factors such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind patterns also contribute to the overall color of the sky.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,7254,22888,29872,310,278,14744,338,8581,491,278,10122,310,2319,26999,310,3161,297,278,25005,393,9432,3578,1250,304,11563,29915,29879,7101,29892,10734,472,3041,25983,29881,10742,2435,4141,9499,29889,4525,3161,526,7233,4115,29891,1754,701,310,28422,1316,408,19100,4790,264,322,22004,20562,5389,311,29892,607,17977,2580,3578,2645,278,2462,29892,9819,297,7254,29899,12692,2927,362,29889,4525,5960,2925,884,17977,29890,12871,515,6575,4366,2645,278,2462,29892,10805,278,4799,304,4953,3109,20619,29892,8236,304,278,12409,310,6133,27091,411,901,7254,22888,267,29889,19814,29892,5164,916,13879,1316,408,15489,8096,293,12959,29892,10430,29892,322,8805,15038,884,29126,304,278,12463,2927,310,278,14744,29889],"total_duration":14753912633,"load_duration":774682500,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":1527534000,"eval_count":137,"eval_duration":12408495000}
